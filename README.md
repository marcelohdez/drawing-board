# Drawing Board
A simple drawing application created purely in Java to challenge myself,
all the visuals are done using Java's Swing framework.

## Building
Being a Gradle project, Drawing Board can be built using gradle's
`build` command. For the specifics on how to do this, keep reading,
otherwise you may skip to the
[Usage section](https://github.com/marcelohdez/drawing-board/#usage).

Download the source code and extract the folder inside, then open the 
extracted folder with your Terminal/Command Prompt.

* **On Windows** cd into the folder and run `gradlew build` in 
Command Prompt or Terminal.
* **On macOS** or other **unix-like OS's** cd into the folder and (you
may need to run `chmod +x gradlew` before this works) run
`./gradlew build` in the terminal.

Once finished, the resulting files will be in the `build` folder.
The .jar will be in `build > libs` and gradle's default run scripts
will be in `build > bin`.

## Usage
Upon opening the program, on the left will be your drawing tools, and
on the right will be the canvas/image tools. You may change your brush
size by 1 pixel by `holding Shift + scrolling`, or by 10% by
`holding ctrl + scrolling`.
